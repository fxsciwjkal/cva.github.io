            Hello, I’m Cva. Welcome to the website I created just for fun! This paragraph is part of my effort to add some flair and personality to the site. I’m known as the 'Parry God' around here, thanks to my impressive skills in Sekiro—I can parry anything! In the future, I hope to visit Japan, and I have a strong passion for beatboxing and uncovering the deeper mysteries of the universe. It’s been great interacting with you. Please feel free to share your feedback about the website. Also, stay tuned as I plan to share some game mods soon. Thank you for visiting, and goodbye for now! ^_^

            <h1>My horror incidents</h1>
            <ul>
               <li> <p>1. Once I was walking by a shop and a man taps my shoulder and said that I am fucking amazing. I panicked and left from there as soon 
                as possible. 5 Years later... Hello my name is bugatti hazarika I am in jail for multiple animal abuse. I once fucked a stray cat, a female cow
                and my pet dog named amazing...
                </p>
                
        </li>

                <li><P>2. It was Aug 5th I was shivering like a nigga, because today I picked cotton whole day and didn't get to make tik tok
                        or any form of brainrot content . I identify myself was an incel. I was raped at the age of 14 at my school
                        . It was my principle who did it. I kept this secret hidden from everyone and I was in the pit of rabbit hole with torture and 
                        daily rapes. I now work as a cotton picker and only get raped twice a day, which was 7 times per day in past few Years
                        I have accepted my way of life but I hope that in my next life i will give this rapist a horrible death. 
                        The End.
                </P></li>
