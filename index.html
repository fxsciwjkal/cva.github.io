            Hello, I am Siva. This is a Website I designed just for fun. Since I needed to write a paragraph to make 
            the website look cool so I am trying to write something. I am very good at Sekiro. Everyone calls me the parry god here 
            , because I can parry anything in Sekiro. I would like to go to japan in future and i like beatboxing and knowing more about 
            the secrets of universe. okay It was a good time interacting with you. Please give feedbacks about the website
            .... And soon I will start sharing cracked version of games here. Thank you and Goodbye ^_^.
        </p>

            <h1>My horror incidents</h1>
            <ul>
               <li> <p>1. Once I was walking by a shop and a man tabs my shoulder and said that I am fucking amazing I panicked and left from there as soon 
                as possible. 5 Years later... Hello my name is bugatti hazarika I am in jail for multiple animal abuses. I once fucked a stray cat, a female cow
                and my pet dog named amazing...
                </p>
                
        </li>

                <li><P>2. It Aug 5th I was shivering like a nigga, because today I picked cotton whole day and didn't get to make tik tok
                        or any form of brainrot contain . I consider myself in the LGBTQ+ community. I was raped at the age of 14 at my school
                        . It was my principle who did it. I kept this thing hidden from everyone and was in the pit of rabbit hole with torture and 
                        daily rapes. I now work as a cotton picker and only get raped twice a day, which was 7 times per day in past few Years
                        I have expected my way of life but I hope that in my next life i will give this rapist a horrible death. 
                        The End.
                </P></li>
